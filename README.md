JavaScript: Password Generator

## User Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Application description

WHEN 'Generate Password' button is clicked, the user is prompted to confirm if they want uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or symbols included in their password. IF none of them are chosen, the user is alerted to pick at least one option and the confirm prompts loop through again. The user is then prompted to enter the number of characters they would like their password to contain, between 8 - 128. IF those parameters are not met, the prompt loops again until the user enters the correct number. IF the user entered everything correctly, the password will display in the 'Your Secure Password' box.
